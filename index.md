I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/epa/">Evolution and Paleobiology</a> at the University of Oslo. In my work I try to understand the evolution of marine organisms in the context of their biotic and abiotic environments, with a focus on crinoid echinoderms.
