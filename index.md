I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/epa/">Evolution and Paleobiology group</a> at the University of Oslo. In my research I try to understand the evolution of marine organisms in the context of their biotic and abiotic environments, with a focus on the crinoid echinoderms. This has led me to work on <a href="https://www.jgsaulsbury.com/projects">macroecology, historical biogeography, ecological theory, and systematic and descriptive paleontology</a>.
