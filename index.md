I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Kansas. My research uses the invertebrate fossil record to address general issues in ecology and evolution, including the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic ecological forces in shaping species' long-term evolutionary fates, the importance of tectonic and oceanographic events in the evolution of marine organisms, and major innovations in inverebrate evolutionary history. <a href="https://jgsaulsbury.com/projects">More info here.</a>
