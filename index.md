I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/epa/">Evolution and Paleobiology group</a> at the University of Oslo. In my research I try to use the invertebrate fossil record to address themes of general ecological and evolutionary significance, including: the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic ecological forces in shaping species' long-term evolutionary fates; the importance of tectonic and oceanographic events in marine invertebrate evolution; and the major innovations that have shaped the history of post-Paleozoic crinoids.
